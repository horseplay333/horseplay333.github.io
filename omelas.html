  The Ones who Walk Away From Omelas - Reflection 
</h1>

<p> 
The Ones who Walk Away from Omelas is a short story written by Ursula K. LeGuin, that depicts a fantasy (and rather utopian) city called Omelas. It tells the story of how Omelas is a  city of joy and happiness, where everyone does nothing but have a wonderful time… all at the expense of one child locked in a cellar under the town. It is said that all of the residents of Omelas know about this child locked in the cellar, and continue to have fun anyhow, knowing their joy is dependent on this child’s suffering. It said that there are people who torment the thought of the child for weeks or even years, and others leave Omelas after seeing the child, walking north and never looking back, no one knows where they go.

This story brings to mind the moral question “would you save yourself and harm the world? Or harm yourself and save the world?” only in this sense, instead of yourself as the deciding factor it is a young child. One question that I begin to think of about the morality and ethics of this story is whether or not the child is aware that the happiness of Omelas rests on their shoulders. While the child is described as maldeveloped and ‘imbecile’, there is also a moment in the story where they describe that the child did have a time when they weren’t locked away. <b>Therefore, I am curious to know whether or not the child learned of its fate and purpose in the town before getting so horribly mistreated. Would that understanding change anything ethically?</b>

Why was that specific child chosen? Was it due to some reason that is not presented in the story? Or were they randomly selected? Does it have to be a child in the cellar below Omelas, or could it be an older individual? I am also curious to know the reasoning as to why there needs to be so much suffering endured by one person in order to ensure the happiness of everyone else. The reading made it seem like this was a necessary thing, therefore it only feels natural to ask why. I feel like there is something being omitted from the reading regarding the reasoning as to why things are the way that they are. This could have been a writing choice, to make the moral lines of Omelas more blurred and convoluted.

I am also curious about those who walk away from Omelas after seeing the child. Do the other people of Omelas know of the ones who walk out of the city in the dead of night? Or is it covered up to preserve their happiness? How would either outcome shape the moral code of the town of Omelas. It is stated in the reading that those who walk away from Omelas know where they are going, but I wonder if they truly or if they just know that they need to get away.

All in all I believe that this is an incredibly thought provoking, heartbreaking and compelling story that plays on morality and ethics in a big way. The story leaves lots of questions unanswered, and unanswerable. The idea of living in a ‘utopia’-like setting while still having the understanding that your own happiness is dependent on the suffering of one, can connect to the present modern day as well. <b>Everything that is positive or happy tends to have a dark side, and I believe that the story of Omelas displays that in a very powerful way.</b>
