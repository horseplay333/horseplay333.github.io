    <h1>Response to AI & Accessibility</h1>
    <p>This article spoke about how AI is improving accessibility by helping those with neurodivergence. It starts with explaining how AI can help neurodivergent students who may struggle with the more traditional school systems. The article explains the logistics of an app called InnerVoice which is an AI with several features to help students of this caliber. One question that a system such as this raises for myself is the notion of who this technology would be accessible to if implemented into schools. As mentioned in the article many learning disabilities go unnoticed, undiagnosed and/or unhelped, especially for younger kids in the public school system. Of course, whether documented or not those with neurodivergence will feel the effects of their disability whether supported or not. This of course leads me to question whether or not technology like this would be given to all students, or just those medically recognized? If the latter proves to be true, what separates something like InnerVoice from traditional accommodations? If it is a matter of being more subtle about who needs the support then this app being given only to those who need it would be counterintuitive. <b> I believe that the only way for something like this to work in practice would be to give it to everyone, and have the app have some sort of self-learning feature where it will be able to learn which students need more support and adjust adequately.</b></p>

    <p>The article goes on to illustrate how AI has been used to level the playing field in the workforce. The reading mentions multiple ways that AI goes about doing this, such as using/generating summaries and abstracts. My fear with this is that it will eliminate the need of writing full reports. If AI gets too good at the act of creating a summary, what is the point of writing the whole thing? It's not just neurodivergent people who would like to save time when reading reports. I have a similar mindset when it comes to the hiring process, another accessibility point mentioned in the reading. I fear that internalized ableism within the system will shoot AI methods such as the one described in the foot. Just proving that AI can achieve feats that make the workforce more accessible does not mean that it will look the same way in practice. Maybe companies will overlook blatant bias in their system as explained in the video we watched for class not long ago. When companies decide to hire neurodivergent employees I also worry that they have the possibility of swinging too far in the opposite direction, when does it turn into a matter of hiring someone because they are fit for the job, or hiring someone because they are neurodivergent. In a perfect world I do not think that disability should have any effect on hiring probability, just like with race, class and gender.</p>
